 Demonstration compression program for 3D images:
 	- hyperspectral images
	- 3D medical images
	- video

 The method is based on 3D SPIHT or 3D EZW with random access and resolution scalability properties.



Installation:

* QccPack
- need the libQccPack installed available at http://qccpack.sourceforge.net/
- QccPack is used only for the wavelet transform and is interfaced by the functions in wavelet_c.c, any other library performing wavelet transform could be implemented.
- if you want to use the compression program without any change, just make sure that libQccPack.so is available.

* 3D SPIHT RARS
- 'make' create and executable and a shared library


Syntax:

Usage:spihtcode [-e | -d] [-r rate] [-s ns nl nb] [-n d1 d2] [-t datatype][filename]
ns: # samples                 [256]
nl: # lines                   [256]
nb: # bands                   [224]
d1: # spectral decompositions [5]
d2: # spatial decompositions  [5]
datatype: 2 short int (default), 1 unsigned char
